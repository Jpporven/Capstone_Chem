      Academic Leader, or Pal for short, haha. '
    - 'In order to be accepted as our new Pal, we will put your chemistry knowledge
      to the test, and what better way than an Escape Room! '
    - "You\u2019ll need to escape two rooms within 30 minutes in order to successfully
      become our newest Pal, seems easy enough, right?\u201D\r"
    - "Before we begin, you might not be too familiar with how things go around here,
      since it\u2019s your first time, allow me to help you."
    - Use your left joystick to move around, you'll be doing that a lot around here.
      Tilt your head to look around your surroundings, try not to trip on anything.
    - Your right joystick lets you look around too, not as reliable as moving that
      noggin of yours yea?
    - Use either the left or right triggers on your controllers to grab or let go
      of anything within the lab rooms. Try grabbing that ball and just throwing
      it.
    - Alright, you seem to be comfortable with how this will go, time for the main
      event!

    sentences:
    - "Here in the first room, your task will be to find the missing 10 elements
      that aren\u2019t showing up in the periodic table you see before you."
    - There are many tools and hints that will help you in solving these tasks. Once
      you correctly identify the element using my special machine, you bring its
      symbol to the periodic table.
    - "Bring them all and you\u2019ll move on to the second room. I\u2019ll touch
      on that room more when you get there, for now, good luck with the first room!"
    - ' Oh, did I forget to mention that your timer started the moment you entered
      the room? Now you know! (laughs).'

    sentences:

      time to become our new Pal. I do hope you return someday and give it a shot

      room, open that door while I explain your next task.
    - "In the second room, you\u2019ll see a large table in front of you and in it,
      a model of an atom with the name next to it. "
    - 'You must be able to make it into an ion by adjusting the number of electrons
      the model has. '
    - "Once you correctly make an ion, the next one will be ready for you to make
      immediately, it\u2019s as simple as it sounds. "
    - 'If you make a mistake with the current atom, hit that button next to the model
      to reset it back to how it was originally. '
    - "Go now! Get to it, you\u2019re still on the clock ya know!"
